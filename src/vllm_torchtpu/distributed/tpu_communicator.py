"""TPU device communicator for EP across data-parallel engines.

Dispatch gathers tokens across DP ranks that share the same TP rank. Combine
sums those matching-TP partials across DP and returns this DP rank's token
slice. vLLM's existing ``reduce_results`` TP all-reduce remains responsible for
the final TP-side reduction. Callers must pass equal token counts on each DP
rank.
